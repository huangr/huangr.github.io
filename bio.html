                <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I am a current second-year majoring in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, hoping to graduate by 2018 with a B.S. in both Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I've gone a long way since discovering a passion for problem solving. Since middle school, I've been heavily involved in math contests, spreading to physics and coding contests in high school.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">My long passion of traversing difficult problems with innovative solutions has led me to where I am now. My dreams all revolve around building answers to the world with software.</p>
                <h2><b>Skills</b></h2>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">In the past, I've dabbled as a researcher, taught students to excel in problem solving, and exposed myself to finance as a software engineer, but I'm always seeking new opportunities! Feel free to check out my resume <a href="./assets/files/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> :)</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col m6 left-align">
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I participated in many math contests in high school, having traveled to Boston, Pasadena, Princeton, and Kansas City to partake in off-site contests. My achievements including qualifying for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad" target="_blank">USA Mathematical Olympiad</a> and winning the 2013 <a href="http://chmmc.caltech.edu" target="_blank">Caltech Harvey-Mudd Math Competition</a>.</p>

            <div class="col m6 left-align">
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I also trained students to excel in math competitions as an instructor for the <a href="https://starleague.us" target="_blank">StarLeague</a> program throughout high school, gaining valuable speaking and lecturing experience as a result. The picture to the left was taken at the 2013 StarLeague Winter Camp, where I was given a best instructor award.</p>

                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">In addition to these opportunities, as a former intern at <a href=http://www.bloomberg.com/ target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, I've developed experience in C++, Java, Python while coding on a Linux machine, and I've also been fortunate enough to dabble in MySQL, R, and Matlab.</p>
                <h2><b>Hobbies</b></h2>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I've attempted (however poorly!) many activities as a kid, including swimming, tennis, taekwondo, and painting.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">One of my primary interests remain within music. Having played piano since I was 3 and violin since I was 10, I have a deep respect for musicians, wishing one day to continue improving within the performing arts.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I also love to travel! In addition to visiting over half of the states, I've traveled to Mexico, Canada, France, England, Scotland, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, China, Taiwan, and most recently, Japan. Here are some pictures from my most recent trip!</p>
