                <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I am a current second-year majoring in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, hoping to graduate by '18 with a B.S. in both Computer Science and Mathematics. I was a software engineer intern at <a href=http://www.bloomberg.com/ target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> during the summer of '16 and a trader intern at <a href=http://www.fiveringscapital.com/ target="_blank">Five Rings Capital</a> during winter '17. Now, I'm an incoming software engineer intern at <a href=https://www.twosigma.com/ target="_blank">Two Sigma Investments</a> during summer '17.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">As of now, I've dabbled as a researcher, taught students to excel in problem solving, and exposed myself to finance as a software engineer, but I'm always seeking new opportunities-- contact me for anything!</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col m12 left-align">
                <h2><b>Skills</b></h2>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I have experience working in C++, Python, and Java from both industry experience and the classroom. I've taken classes in both operating systems and machine learning, while developing an interest in potentially doing my Masters of Engineering in artificial intelligence. A list of my current course experience can be found <a href="https://courseroad.mit.edu/#rickh" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I participated in many math contests in high school, having traveled to Boston, Pasadena, Princeton, and Kansas City to partake in off-site contests. My achievements including qualifying for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad" target="_blank">USA Mathematical Olympiad</a> and winning the 2013 <a href="http://chmmc.caltech.edu" target="_blank">Caltech Harvey-Mudd Math Competition</a>. I am still involved with math contests to this day, volunteering numerous times and being a previous Guts Round Director for the <a href=https://www.hmmt.co target="_blank">Harvard-MIT Math Tournament</a>.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">Additionally, I have experience working with students. I trained students to excel in math competitions as an instructor for the <a href="https://starleague.us" target="_blank">StarLeague</a> program throughout high school, gaining valuable speaking and lecturing experience as a result. At the 2013 StarLeague Winter Camp, I was given a best instructor award.</p>

                <h2><b>Hobbies</b></h2>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I've attempted (however poorly!) many activities as a kid, including swimming, tennis, taekwondo, and drawing.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">One of my primary interests remain within music. I've been blessed with perfect pitch, and I've also won numerous awards from the <a href="https://usomc.org" target="_blank">US Open Music Competition</a> in the past along with completing the Certificate of Merit, Level 10 program for piano in middle school. If I had not discovered math contests, I would have most likely become a musician!</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">In stark contrast with the arts, I also love playing Texas Hold'em. I am a member of the <a href="https://poker.scripts.mit.edu/">MIT Poker Club</a>, and I also play $1/$2 No-Limit Texas Hold'em occasionally.</p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">I also love to travel! I plan to travel to Calgary, Canada during summer '17, and I also plan on making a tour around Korea and Southeast Asia during winter '17. </p>
                <p class="left-align white-text" id="par-info">In the past, I've traveled to Mexico, Canada, France, England, Scotland, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, China, Taiwan, and most recently, Japan. Here are some pictures from my most recent trip!</p>
